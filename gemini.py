ifscCode: Bank’s IFSC code.
Ensure the JSON object format is clean, with each extracted field labeled precisely by the above field names, capturing all required information accurately. Do not omit or miss any details. If a field is not found, return it as an empty string or null to maintain consistency. Structure and separate each extracted field clearly to avoid any ambiguity in the output format.
